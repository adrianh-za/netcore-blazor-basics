# netcore-blazor-basics
Set of web projects to learn Blazor basics.  The primary app to execute is `BlazorWebAppDemo`.  Look into the `Components/Demo` folder and merely browse to any of the pages to see that specific demo working.

Was done as part of the [Getting Started: Blazor](https://dometrain.com/course/getting-started-blazor/) course located at [Dometrain](https://dometrain.com/). For this reason, the implementations may not be ideal as a few features were implemented to get an understanding of said feature.
